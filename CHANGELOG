SpeakIt 0.3 <July 24 1999>

* FIXED IN THIS RELEASE / OR ADDED FEATURES *
- Redesigned the internal guts of the program, should be much more efficient now.
- Switched to the new BGameSound class which seemed to fix the strange sound playback
  in R4.5.
- Because we made the above switch R4.5 will be needed to run this app, unless we receive
  requests for a R4 version.
- Removed the 100 character limit, now can change it from the settings menu.

  being played when user presses enter at end.

- Fixed a bug in the sound code that caused a memory leak. Thanks to Sean
