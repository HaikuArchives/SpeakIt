<FONT COLOR="#e40000" SIZE=5>SpeakIt v0.4</FONT>
<br><br>
<FONT  SIZE=3>This program reads the typed in text and searches a folder called 'words' for
a sound file that corresponds to each individual word in the sentence. So the 
more sound files in the 'word' folder the more words that can be spoken from 
the input sentence. A sample collection of words can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.hailstonesoftware.com/progs/words.zip">The Hailstone Web site</a> (396kb)</FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#0000e4" SIZE=5>Notes on source code</FONT> 
<br><br> 

<FONT  SIZE=3>
- The source is being released because Sean, the guy at Hailstone who wrote this app, does not have time to update it
and does not want to see the app just die off.<br>
- This program was originally written to learn the Be API and as such is not structured all that well.<br>
- The PowerPC version would not compile with the cross platform tools, however the source is now
available for someone to compile it on a PowerPC machine.<br>
<br>
POSSIBLE ITEMS TO ADD:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Open plain text files and then speak.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - A monitor mode that will import any new text put on the clipboard.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Drag and Drop support for text.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Allow user to change delay between words spoken.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Squash any bugs in the program.<br>
